# BaltiFuzz VST3 Plugin

BaltiFuzz is a VST3 audio effect plugin that combines distortion, bitcrushing, and mixing effects to create unique and gritty sounds. It offers a range of parameters to shape the sound, including fuzz, drive, output gain, mix, tone, bit depth, and sample rate.

## Features

- **Fuzz effect** with adjustable intensity
- **Drive control** for adding saturation and distortion
- **Output gain** to control the overall volume
- **Mix knob** to blend the processed and dry signals
- **Tone control** to shape the frequency response
- **Bit depth reduction** for lo-fi and bitcrushed sounds
- **Sample rate reduction** for unique aliasing effects
- **Soft clipping** with adjustable threshold and clipping curve
- **Stereo processing** for wide and immersive sounds

## Parameters

- **Fuzz**: Controls the amount of fuzz applied to the signal (0.0 to 1.0)
